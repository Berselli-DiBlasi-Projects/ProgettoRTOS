# ProgettoRTOS
Image processing. Simulate a fixed camera looking at a given portion of an animated screen and write 4 periodic tasks performing different computations on the same image and displaying the results on other images. For example, task1 displays the histogram, task2 displays the image after applying a threshold, task3 displays the difference between consecutive frames, task4 displays the result of a filter. The user must be able to vary some parameters of such tasks.
